1. initialize a dict of lists. populate with user data, inserting customer_ids as keys and a list of tuples storing remaining user data as values. That is, each tuple element in the list has the username, active status, and the date the user was created
2. Iterate the customer data and use the customer id to get the list of user data. Iterate the user list and generate a list of active users. Do the same for inactive users. Hint: list comprehensions
4. Iterate the user list once more and get the most recently created user. Hint: you can use a lambda expression here in a dict comprehension
5. append a dict with specified output format to the list of results
